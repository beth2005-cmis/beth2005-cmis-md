					Lists and Links

				<p>
					In this assignment, I created a new folder called "listsandlinks" in my repository folder and added links to it so that I can move through files.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.
Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css" </li>
					<li>In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.
